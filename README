This is a test at configuring VSCODE for use with STM32 mcus using cortex-debug plugin, with readable config files.

Debugger is a WeAct DAP-link/CMSIS-DAP debugger through openOCD. Only things needed to be added to PATH are arm-none-eabi-gcc.exe directory, and make.exe directory.

Linkerfile generated using STM32CubeMX set to Makefile mode was broken, correct one generated by setting to CubeIDE mode and then copying over.

This does nothing but initialize the UART peripheral at this time.

Bugs:
I don't think it is running the "make all -j4" command automatically. Might need to make a tasks.json. Ew.
