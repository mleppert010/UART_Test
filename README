This is a test at configuring VSCODE for use with STM32 mcus using cortex-debug plugin, with readable config files.

Debugger is a WeAct DAP-link/CMSIS-DAP debugger through openOCD. Only things needed to be added to PATH are arm-none-eabi-gcc.exe directory, and make.exe directory.

Linkerfile generated using STM32CubeMX set to Makefile mode was broken, correct one generated by setting to CubeIDE mode and then copying over.

This does nothing but initialize the UART peripheral at this time.

How to use:
- Update last two defines in c_cpp_properties.json to match whatever is in STM32CubeMX generated makefile (device dependant)
- Update executable file path to right file name in launch.json
- Set correct device in launch.json
- Download/set correct svd file in launch.json
- Select correct OpenOCD scripts in launch.json
- Make sure toolchain paths are set correctly in settings.json

To Do:
- I don't think it is running the "make all -j4" command automatically. Might need to make a tasks.json. Ew.
- See if I can use a variable for the "output_filename".elf in launch.json so I don't have to ever update it
